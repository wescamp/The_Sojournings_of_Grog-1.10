NAGAS/SAURIANS
--------------

Like other campaigns.

>>Speach 

Both races in mainline tend just to emphasis s's. In TSoG we change this so that the saurians tend to speak German: "yourz name will also go on ze list".
 
TROLLS
------

Trust worthy, Undauntable, strong, slow to act etc. Very poor communication.

>>Speach

Third person, bad grammer.


GRYPHONS
--------

Fairly mainline 

>>Speach

Unlike other campaigns the gryphons (rathe than their riders speak). They speak like Krawg in SoF.

OGRES
-----

bad grammer. Tend to put predicate before verb if transitive. For crude tech just write sentance and flip around till looks funny then stop. Also tend to add ee to end. really thick. 

Quote from "Peta Fit, non Nascitur" by Lewis Carroll

For first you write a sentance,
  And then you chop it small;
Then mix the bits, and sort them out
  Jut as they cchance to fall:
The order of the phrases makes
  No differance at all.

HUMANS
------

In this campaign these are a very haughty race of humans. They are, unashamedly, modeled on the men of the lake in LotR.
They are hardened by many battles, dont readily give or accept help. There is a very honour bound culture amongst them. This is the reason why the free humans from A5 commit suicide if Ormron dies.

"Dis a troll bridge. You pay toll. Er..."
"Dat not right. Dis a toll bridge. You pay troll. Er..."
"Dat not right either. Big words confuse Gronk. You pay now or we smash you."
