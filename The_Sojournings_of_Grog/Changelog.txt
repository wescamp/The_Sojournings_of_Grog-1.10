* B4: added Daravel's dialogue revision, only if Ormron is alive (for now).

* A6, B2: fixed inconsistencies between these two maps.
* Added updated Great Ogre baseframe by Monroid.
* Committed new Gold Mage unit made by SomeOneNamedMe: this means that Elyssa can now advance to Level 4 also if the player chooses the Silver Mage advancement. Due to the way that I had to use to implement this (adding a new unit line, since [advancefrom] don't work for high experience), it takes effect only after restarting the campaign.
* Modified Elyssa creator, ELYSSA_SWORD and OBJ_STAFF_OF_THE_RAGING_SEA macros for managing the new Elyssa upgrade.
* Fixed a bug in Elyssa creator that replaced Elyssa's resistances instead of increasing them.  Now her resistances are increased by +10% to fire and cold.

* hack start: added a menu to allow the player choosing if Elyssa should be a Great or Gold Mage.
* S1: added a description for the Holy Water item, copied from UtBS.
* unit-create.cfg: now the Desert Druid is resilient, quick and healthy. Removing quick will create problems in caves, removing resilient will make her too weak, so now she has three traits.
* B4: if the player lost Ormron, the Drakes have less gold to make it easier to reach the signpost.
* B3: removed Orcs, now the scenario is Grog vs two Saurians vs two Saurians. The plan is to have a war agains these Saurians, and the dialogue still needs to be written.

* Added a sort-of shadow to the Great Ogre sprite.
* A2: called NEAREST_HEX macro to avoid creating Og the Clever in cave wall.

* A1: removed old Undead side spotted by shadowblack.
* A7, items: renamed Poisonous Talons to Poison Potion.
* A7: removed the Power Orbs, that are no longer needed since Mal-Apophis is no longer invulnerable in A3. Still kept the flashes sequence, to make his death more impressive.
* Removed Power Orb units and their halos.
* Removed breaking  glass sound (that was used only by Power Orbs) and changed credits according to this.
* A7: removed the "hammer" word from the Lich death message, to make it compatible also for non-Trolls units, as Eros pointed.

From version 2.8.4 to 2.9.0:
* Fixed Lava Beasts and Lava Monsters defense in lava: now they have 40% instead of 0%.

* S4: added in two story screens the image of the Sceptre of Fire, from SoF campaign before that it was mainlined.
* A3: added a new prisoner overlay. This is the ruby overlay from SoF, before its mainlining.

* A5: added Daravel's dialogue rewriting.

* C1-Jaash: fixed a location outside the Mermen castle that allowed Jaash to win the scenario.
* A3: added the NEAREST_HEX macro to unstore units only in hexes without impassable terrains and without any unit.
* Backported new mainline Armageddon Drake sprites from 1.9. Used for the Drake Ambassador and for every other Drake that may level up.
* Added new Young Gryphon unit: basically, it's an unmounted Gryphon rider. Recolouring of Gryphon unit made by Elvish_Hunter (me!).
* Added also Gryphon TSoG unit: base unit is mainline Gryphon, with hitpoints and movement of mainline Gryphon Master.
* Added Elder Cactose sprite (baseframe only) made by Phyreprooph. Check out his Wose faction, he really deserves it ;-)
* A7: added Daravel's dialogue rewriting, also implemented a workaround to show the prisoner image instead of unknow unit (using variables), replaced *swish* with a floating tag.
* S2: added Daravel's dialogue rewriting and added back the code for storing the human portraits and show them as story screens, because [store_unit] filters also in the recall list, if needed. I hope that everything works.
* A2/A4: copied the map of the river zone from A2, pasted in A4 and a bit modified in both scenarios to have the same map in that zone as Daravel suggested.
* A7: copied the lower part of the map from First Contact and pasted here, as suggested by Daravel. Also, a bit modified to allow freeing all prisoners even without Gryphons.

* Committed new White Troll unit, originally created by the Wesnoth Italian Forum, with some modifications (arcane attack, decreased XP).

* Added Phyreprooph to credits, for the Elder Cactose sprite.
* A2: added a special loyal White Troll inside a cage. Name: Gong.
* Committed Power Orb unit, with halos. Based on ball items.
* A7: added three Power Orbs, with their halo (recoloured by me). These needs to be destroyed before killing Mal Apophis. May move them in future. Added also the code to manage their destruction and to make Mal-Apophis invulnerable before destroying them.
* Added breaking glass sound from Worldforge, as Power Orb death sound.
* Committed new Great Ogre baseframe, made by Monroid, and added him to credits.
* B2: reworked the victory event to allow winning by placing Grog and Elyssa near the signpost, using [have_unit] and removed variables.
* B2: moved HIGHLIGHT_IMAGE for signpost before the objective change.

* B1: removed three unuseful MOODIFY_UNIT. Also fixed a MOVE_UNIT_FAKE that used a Dwarvish Lord instead of a Dragonguard.
* B1: added Daravel's dialogue revision.
* B1: modified event for Dwarvish gold from side turn to side 1 turn, and removed a variable check, to avoid the player being attacked by green and blue Dwarves before the thunderstorm, as Daravel suggested.
* Added Dibs, mich and the Wesnoth Italian Forum to the credits, for the White Troll unit.
* C1-Jaash: changed to make use of SCATTER_UNITS macro, with 30 Cactose and 10 Elder Cactose.
* C1-Zurg: changed to make use of SCATTER_UNITS macro.
* Added a White Troll to the hack start.
* Added Tet to credits, for teaching me how to scale unit sprites.
* Decreased Great Ogre melee attack from 16 to 15, as Tet suggested.

From version 2.8.3 to 2.8.4:

* Imported NEAREST_HEX macro from Dead Water, but not yet used.
* Prologue: added new Daravel's dialogue corrections.
* A1: added new Daravel's dialogue corrections.
* A2: fixed tunnel leading nowhere by adding a cave hex at 35,53. 
* A2: fixed naga spawned in cave wall by changing the naga location to 80,27 and making that hex deep water, because the player hasn't any unit that can go in deep water (not even the Desert Shyde/Star).
* A2: commented out the hurry line that an elf said entering the tunnels. Not removed yet, because probably I'll change it to another type of event.
* Ported new fangs-ant.png (Giant Ant fangs attack icon) from UtBS.
* A2: added new Daravel's dialogue corrections.
* A2: Now Elyssa no longer teleports to destroy the walls, but just walks and then goes back to her original hex. Also Grog does no longer teleport when meeting the Death Knight, but just walks. And yes, the MOVE_UNIT macro allows Elyssa and Grog to walk through enemy units, if necessary.
* A1: Now the Bandits pop out in the middle of Elyssa and Grog dialogue.
* A5: Added partial Daravel's dialogue rewriting.
* A3: Fixed a bug that allowed collapsing the bridge multiple times.

* B6: modified the sighted wose event: one is sighted, the other is now moveto+[filter_vision], and to create a second_unit the NEAREST_UNIT macro is used.

From version 2.8.2 to 2.8.3:
* A3: Added Daravel's dialogues, again with some use of Pango markup.
* Fixed macro THUNDER_AND_LIGHTNING: made the code simpler and now the lightning bolt points correctly to the hexes that Elyssa destroys. Downsides: the code is longer and now there are 12 more images in images/halo. This because there isn't an offset key for [item] tag, and this forced me to copy and resize mainline halos.
* Fixed location of one THUNDER_AND_LIGHTNING in A2
* A4: added Daravel's dialogue. Changed also one Troll role, from "hot" to "fun".
* Updated E-kills.cfg: I read the changelog, and there is written that there are three new terrains from 1.6 to 1.8: drake village, orcish fort and keep, orcish village. This is what I decided:
	- Drake village (Rr^Vd) will not change.
	- Orcish fort and keep (Co, Ko) will not change.
	- Orcish snow villages (Ha^Voa, Aa^Voa) will become orcish villages (Hh^Vo, Gg^Vo).

* Prologue: added Daravel's dialogues and uncommented two story screens (text only).
* A1: added Daravel's dialogues and removed ghost spawning code (that was already commented out anyway).
* A7: fixed a bug in macro ORMRON_TALK: if not having a spokesman and a sidekick, such units are recalled, and this crashes Wesnoth. To me, this seems an engine bug. As a failsafe code, if the player doesn't have such units, their messages are said by Elyssa and Zurg.
* A7 and S2: due to fix above, commented [store_unit] for spokesman and sidekick. Also, temporary fixed S2, using spearman and bowman portraits as portraits for spokesman and sidekick respectively.
