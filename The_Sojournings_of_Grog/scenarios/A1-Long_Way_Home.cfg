            # originally they were bandits
            # wmllint: local spelling Khalifa
            story= _"Grog led the Elves south across the harsh desert, they moved as hastily as possible between the sparse oases. Very few people ventured this far into the desert and they saw only a few creatures for six days and nights. Up ahead the keen eyes of the Elves had spied a Khalifa encampment guarding the next watering hole - they would have to fight their way to it. But their spirits rose as they knew they must now be nearing the edge of the desert."
