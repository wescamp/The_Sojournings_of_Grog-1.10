#
# MAP
#
# The whole map is under ground.
# In the SE the is an entrance where desert has blown into the caves.
# The undead leader is positioned there.
# A road starts on the eastern end of the N border.
# It travels down to meet the entrance. (you start on this road)
# There is a dwarvish threone room on the eastern edge of the map.
#
# STRATEGY
#
# Kill E V E R Y T H I N G (Except the undead!) that "crawls on the face of the earth".
#
# TODO
#
# 4) remove loyal markers from the guards
# 5) make the undead prefer to attack fully healed units to leave some experience for you
# + TODOs in code
#
# NOTES
#
# 1) removed dwarvish runesmith and death baron. the bone knight could also go if you want.
### For me, it isn't a problem keeping the Death Baron as well. E_H.
# 2) I have redone the dialog. I think this version is more realistic than the last and explains whats happening better.
#    I prefer it a lot but its not perfect. Feel free to adjust as appropriate.
